# OSNIT--Reverse-Image-Search-Task1
Completed the first week Task of OSINT short course by Secured India, covering the fundamentals of reverse image search and hands-on practice through a practical lab and interactive game to apply investigative techniques.
1.Module Completion (Intro to OSINT): 
Why Timestamps Matter 
Examples of Open Sources for OSINT 
2. Practical Lab (Sofia Santos) :
objetive: 
To verify the authenticity of a journalist’s claim regarding a suicide attack in 
Khyber, Pakistan by analysing whether the shared image accurately represents the reported 
event.
 After conducting a reverse image search using TinEye, I reviewed multiple sources     
and ultimately traced the image to a Wikipedia article, where I studied the case in 
detail and confirmed the original context and accurate information about the incident.
Conclusion:  
The image shared by the journalist does not depict the suicide attack in Khyber city 
on January 19, 2023. It was misattributed and reused from a previous, unrelated 
incident. This confirms the task statement: “The photo is not of the event described 
by the journalist.”

4. Reflection (Short Write-Up): 
 This week, I learned how to effectively use reverse image search tools like Google 
Lens to identify individuals, how to manipulate URLs to uncover hidden pages, and 
how to decode password formats based on contextual clues.I also gained experience 
in verifying identities across platforms such as LinkedIn, Xing, and Stack Overflow. 
One technique I want to explore further is Bitly link analysis, especially how metadata 
can reveal critical timestamps and redirect paths.  
 A major challenge I faced was dealing with blank or misleading web pages; I 
overcame this by experimenting with URL extensions like "/folder" to access hidden 
content. These skills have sharpened my ability to think creatively and critically—
 essential traits for future OSINT tasks where uncovering hidden information and 
verifying sources are key to success.
